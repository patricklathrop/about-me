    <br>
    <p>Hello visitor and welcome to my personal About-Me page. My name is Pat Lathrop and my personal life education and
        experience is a sordid affair. I first learned to distill moonshine with my grand pappy at the young age of 12
        and later began distilling all sorts of fine whiskey and brandy.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> During my moonshining apprenticeship, it was important to keep our still locations private, which led to me
            having extensive knowledge of the foothills and trails all around the Pacific Northwest. This knowledge
            helped me become a volunteer forestry ranger and later a search and rescue volunteer. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Through this I developed a familiarity with the fauna of the Pacific Northwest; however, not even this
            prepared me for the events of March 2000 along the Pacific Coast Trail, near Packwood Lake. Not to get into
            too much detail, but those events led me onto a lifelong study in cryptozoology, particularly the search for
            Bigfoot.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I spent nearly three years living in the woods and tracking every possible bigfoot sighting available, many
            of the same ones reported to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) website. For more information
            on the BFRO, check out https://www.bfro.net. </p>
