        <h1>This page is <em>possibly</em> about me</h1>
        <p>Hello user and welcome to my personal About-Me page.  My name is Pat Lathrop and my personal life education and experience is a sordid affair.  I first learned to distill moonshine with my grand pappy at the young age of 12 and later began distilling all sorts of fine whiskey and brandy.  My moonshining apprenticeship in the backwoods of Washington state led to having an extensive knowledge the foothills and trails all around the Pacific Northwest in order to keep our still locations private.  This knowledge helped me become a volunteer forestry ranger and later a search and rescue volunteer.  Through this I developed a familiarity with the fauna of the Pacific Northwest, which left me totally unprepared for the events of March 2000 along the Pacific Coast Trail, near Packwood Lake.  Not to get into too much detail, but those events led me onto a lifelong study in cryptozoology, particularly the search for Bigfoot.  I spent nearly three years living in the woods and tracking every possible bigfoot sighting available, many of the same ones reported to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) website.
