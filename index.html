            <h2> Biography</h2>
            <p>Hello visitor and welcome to my personal About-Me page.  My name is Pat Lathrop and my personal life education and experience is a sordid affair.  I first learned to distil moonshine with my grand pappy at the young age of 12 and later began distilling all sorts of fine whiskey and brandy.  
            <br> <br>  
            <p> During my moonshining apprenticeship, it was important to keep our still locations private, which led to me having extensive knowledge of the foothills and trails all around the Pacific Northwest. This knowledge helped me become a volunteer forestry ranger, fire spotter and later a search and rescue volunteer.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>Through this I developed a familiarity with the fauna of the Pacific Northwest; however, not even this prepared me for the events of March 2000 along the Pacific Coast Trail, near Packwood Lake.  Not to get into too much detail, but those events led me onto a lifelong study in cryptozoology, particularly the search for Bigfoot.</p>
            <br>   
            <p>I spent nearly three years living in the woods and tracking every possible bigfoot sighting available, many of the same ones reported to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) website.  For more information on the BFRO, check out https://www.bfro.net.  </p>
